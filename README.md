# data_exploration
personal project - part 1: Data analysis and visualization in python

random implementations of various data exploration methods here.
I had no background in statistics or data analysis, thought this
would be a fun way to learn about some of it.

"progress files" contains an unorganized array of files that were used to help me 
learn and become familiar with the tools and data I was using. There are comments
if the files, but there is no defined usage for them.

"graphs" contains png files of the graphs ultimately chosen for generation, as well 
as their oddly behaving counterparts used in the examples of the report. 

"current_files" contains the most recent exploration methods and usage instructions
